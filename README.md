# 🐚 Personal dotfiles

Configuration files for my development environment.

Even though my preferences might not perfectly match what you need, you can use
the structure of this repository as a guide to creating your own dotfiles.

## Installation

locations:

```sh
init.sh [zsh] [bash]
```

  prompt
